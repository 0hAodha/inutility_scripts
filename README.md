# `inutility_scripts`: a collection of miscellaneous scripts that don't do anything useful
This repository was created as a sister repository to the more practical [`utility_scripts`](https://github.com/0hAodha/utility_scripts)
repository to house scripts that were not useful enough to earn a place in there.

## Overview
 - `recursive.sh`: a script that calls itself.
 - `self_destruct.sh`: a script that deletes itself.
 - `suicidal.sh`: a script that kills the process that's executing it, i.e. itself.
 - `trippy.sh`: a script that displays random visual data to the screen (only works when called from a TTY, by a user who has write access to the `fb0` device, e.g. `root`).
