# `inutility_scripts`: a collection of miscellaneous scripts that don't do anything useful
This repository was created as a sister repository to the more practical [`utility_scripts`](https://github.com/0hAodha/utility_scripts)
repository to house scripts that were not useful enough to earn a place in there.

## Overview of Scripts
 - `recursive.sh`: a script that calls itself
 - `suicidal_script.sh`: a script that deletes itself.
